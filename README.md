### Installation.

The easiest time you'll have installing this bot is in a UNIX like environment such a Linux/BSD.

You made need sudo access for pip3 access aswell as ffmpeg installed on your system if you want to play music over voice channels.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Virtual-/JadedBot
$ cd JadedBot
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ touch configfile
```

Notice at the end we created a configfile. This is the file that will hold the settings we need in order for the bot to work properly so edit the file and input the following:

```
[JadedBot]
TOKEN = DISCORDTOKENHERE
REDDIT_ID = REDDITTOKENHERE
REDDIT_SECRET = REDDITSECRETHERE
```

These entries in the file need to be filled, the top `TOKEN` is your discord API key. The following two are only necessary if you want reddit functionality. If you want that follow this [guide](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html).

Start up the program with `$ python3 jaded.py`. It's best to run this in the background somehow, there are various ways to do this on Linux/BSD systems with GNU Screen, Tmux or simply running `$ python3 jaded.py &`.
